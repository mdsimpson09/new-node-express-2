### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
  JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, self-contained means of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications and are often used to verify the identity of the client.


- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
  The signature portion of a JWT is one of its three parts, alongside the header and the payload. It is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the token. The signature is generated by signing the encoded header and encoded payload with a secret key or private key. Upon receiving a JWT, the recipient can recompute the signature using the same algorithm and verify that it matches the signature provided in the token. If the signatures match, it indicates that the token has not been tampered with and can be trusted.


- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
  Yes, the payload of a JWT is base64-encoded, not encrypted. Base64 encoding is a reversible process, so if an attacker intercepts a JWT, they can decode the payload and see its contents. For this reason, it's important not to store sensitive information in the payload of a JWT unless it's meant to be publicly accessible.


- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
  Authentication with JWT typically involves the following high-level steps:
User logs in with valid credentials (e.g., username and password).
The server verifies the credentials and generates a JWT containing user information.
The server sends the JWT to the client.
The client stores the JWT securely (e.g., in a cookie or local storage).
For subsequent authenticated requests, the client includes the JWT in the request header.
The server verifies the JWT's signature and, if valid, processes the request and identifies the user based on the JWT payload.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
  Unit tests focus on testing individual units or functions of code in isolation. They are typically written by developers and aim to verify that small, specific pieces of code behave as expected.
  
  Integration tests verify interactions between different units or components within an application. They test how these units work together and may involve testing the integration of APIs, databases, or services.
  
  End-to-end tests, also known as functional tests, simulate user interactions with the entire application from start to finish. They test the application's functionality as a whole and are often used to ensure that the entire system works correctly.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
  A mock is a simulated object or function used in testing to mimic the behavior of real components or dependencies. Mocks are used to isolate the code being tested and control its interactions with external systems or components. 
  
Some things you might mock in testing include:
External APIs or services to avoid making actual network requests.
Database interactions to avoid modifying real data during testing.
Functions or modules that have not been implemented yet or are unavailable.

- What is continuous integration?
  Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository multiple times a day. The goal is to detect integration issues early by automatically building, testing, and validating code changes as they are pushed to the repository. CI helps maintain code quality, detect bugs, and ensure that new code does not break existing functionality.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
  An environment variable is a variable that is defined outside of an application's code and is part of the environment in which the application runs. Environment variables are used to store configuration settings, sensitive information (such as API keys or database credentials), and other parameters that may vary between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). They provide a way to configure an application without hardcoding values into the code, making it more flexible and secure.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written before writing the actual code. The process typically involves the following steps: write a failing test, write the code to make the test pass, refactor the code if needed.
    benefits-  Improved code quality and reliability.
    Early detection of bugs and issues.
    Faster development cycles once the process is established.
    Clearer requirements and design through writing tests first.
    
    cons- Initial overhead of writing tests before code.
    May lead to over-testing or tests that are too tightly coupled to implementation.
    Requires discipline and practice to implement effectively.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
 JSONSchema is a specification for defining the structure, constraints, and validation rules for JSON data. Using JSONSchema for validation offers several benefits:
  Ensures data consistency and integrity by defining a clear schema.
  Helps in documenting the expected structure of JSON data.
  Enables automated validation of incoming data, reducing the risk of data errors and security vulnerabilities.
  Supports interoperability by providing a standardized way to describe JSON data structures.

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
 Code coverage analysis: Determine which parts of the code are covered by existing tests and prioritize testing areas with low coverage.
  Critical functionality: Prioritize testing for critical features and functionality that have a significant impact on the application's behavior.
  Code changes: Focus testing on recently modified or added code to ensure that changes do not introduce regressions.
  Error-prone areas: Test code that historically has been prone to bugs or issues.
  Business logic: Prioritize testing the core business logic of the application to ensure its correctness.
  User pathways: Test code related to common user workflows and interactions.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
  RETURNING is a clause in SQL used in certain database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL) to return the values of columns affected by a INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It allows you to retrieve data from rows that have been modified by the statement and use that data for further processing or to confirm the changes.
  You would use RETURNING when you need to obtain the values of specific columns that were modified by a data manipulation statement. For example, after inserting a new row into a table, you can use RETURNING to get the values of auto-generated keys or computed columns.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
Web Sockets:
Provides full-duplex communication, allowing both the client and server to send messages independently.
Designed for real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools.
Maintains a continuous connection between the client and server until explicitly closed.
Low latency and reduced overhead compared to HTTP for real-time communication.

HTTP:
Typically follows a request-response model where the client sends a request, the server processes it, and sends a response.
Suitable for traditional web applications where the client primarily requests data or resources from the server.
Connection is stateless; each request is independent, and the connection is closed after each response.
Higher overhead due to headers in each request and response.



- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
    - I enjoyed flask a lot more. it felt more user friendly. I also prefered it when using python vs JS. Flask is also easier to debug applications
